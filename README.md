# HTML & CSS Styling Demonstrations

This project contains two simple HTML files demonstrating different methods of applying CSS styles to web content.

## Files Included

### 1. css1.html

- Demonstrates the use of *internal CSS*.
- Creates a *traffic light UI* using <div> elements.
- Uses flexbox layout to arrange lights (Red, Yellow, Green) vertically.
- Each light is styled with different colors and text labels (MCA, BCA, BBA).

### 2. css(2).html

- Demonstrates *inline CSS* applied directly to HTML elements.
- Contains an explanation about inline styling written in three <p> tags.
- Each paragraph is uniquely styled using inline attributes like background-color, color, border, and padding.
- A base64-encoded *background image* is set using internal CSS for the body.

## Purpose

This project aims to:

- Show how to style elements using internal and inline CSS.
- Help understand the pros and cons of each CSS method.
