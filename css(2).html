    <p style="background-color: orange; border: 2px solid red;">The inline method in CSS is used to apply styles directly within an HTML element using the style attribute. This method gives the highest priority to the styles applied, overriding internal and external CSS rules. It is useful for quick styling changes or when only a single element needs to be styled differently.However, using inline styles extensively can make the code messy and difficult to manage, especially in larger projects. It also violates the principle of separating content from design. Inline CSS cannot handle pseudo-classes or media queries efficiently. For better scalability and maintainability, it's recommended to use internal or external stylesheets instead.The inline method in CSS is used to apply styles directly within an HTML element using the style attribute.
